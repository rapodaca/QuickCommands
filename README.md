#QuickCommands: Simple, useful commands for Bukkit servers

Teleport commands take the first few initals of a player. For example, to teleport
Bob to Lewis, all you need to type is:

/tp b l

Nice, huh?

/tp overrides the existing Bukkit teleport command.

/cp (checkpoint) lets you set a checkpoint location and return to it later
(for example, when you get lost).

Usage:

-  **/tp \<targetPlayer\> \<sourcePlayer\>** teleports targetPlayer to sourcePlayer
-  **/cp set set checkpoint to your current location
-  **/cp return to your previous checkpoint
